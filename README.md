#### progress log 1802 -Natalie
compared datasets (csv of California city vs stations)
matched the fire station shortcode to their full name
(next step: match the fire station name to the city)
tried to fetch city label for all the fire and weather stations [some are still missing and i have no idea which city it belongs to;( ]
made 2 folder for working data and archived/original data separately -- easier access

##### please send help for the city identification: missing city for fire station
geocoder would be a good resource (but i tried 3 times it still couldnt recognise)
